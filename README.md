!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!

Useage: python3 QS.py -keysize 60

Notes: Just uploaded my latest iterations (5 march 2025). It now uses linear congruences to generate numbers less then N which are then tested for smoothness.

Better version will be released soon...


Update: Absolute shit day. My Belgian bank is closing my account without stating a reason. Some days, it feels like people are making my life as miserable as possible. Just adding extra stress to everything to push my over the edge. 
I got to get out of this country soon, no matter what. I refuse to die here like this. Very late start... but lets finish the algorithm now... time to get to work. One final effort. LETS GO.

Update: hehe, this works. Let me finish a first rough outline in code tonight, then finetune it tomorrow and release.

Europeans are massive hypocrites. Everyone saying how they need to increase defense spending, meanwhile, someone with actual skills, is being labeled as a fucking terrorist, and people are literally being told not to do business with me.. I wouldn't even be suprised if the closing of my bank account is related. They are literally trying to get me to commit suicide by making sure it is impossible for me to make a living here. I know how it is. Fucking shitheads. I'm too proud for this shit, and I will go where people want me, and after a year of unemployment, it is clear to me that is not going to be in Europe. Even in fucking America, people showed me more respect, atleast the FBI there tried to make arrangements, even if the state department wasnt able to arrange for a visa, but atleast they tried, atleast they made the gesture. In europe, its complete fucking bullshit. Fucking shit people. I swear, if I ever meet one of these dickheads who has been telling potential buyers to stay away from me, I will fucking end them. I'm not even kidding. I'll fucking end them. Bunch of fucking amateurs btw. Like, you got programs in the Belgian military to find android flaws? What are you gonna do? Hack soldier's google pixel phone when war breaks out? Fucking short sighted idiots.

Before summer I will permanently depart Europe. I make this vow. I'm not staying here. No fucking way. I rather go to China or some place, where people actually respect me for my work.
I'm not afraid of western intel. I'll fight all these fucking spooks. Stay the fuck away from me bunch of fucking no skill losers.

ps: My algorithm works beautifully now. It is exactly what I wanted to do. It literally finds smooths faster then anything else out there. Go to hell. Go to hell for everything.

I tried to do the right thing. I really tried. Got threatened with a gun, got harassed, went after my manager too and fired him, ruined my life, seperated me from my friends, ended up back in Europe, where nothing happens and law enforcement is telling people they will sanction them if they do business with me... even closed my fucking bank account for whatever reason. You are forcing an outcome which fits your narrative by literally giving me no other choice. I finished a first rough draft tonight. It works. So either tomorrow or this weekend, it will appear here on this github page. 

Here is what the next update is going to include: Calculate quadratic coefficients for each prime in the factor base. Squares them and calculates how much N needs to be subtracted to reach 0. Adds this info to a hash map. Then we collect all of them where N is subtracted once (and then twice, three times... etc until we have enough smooths) ... multiplies them together until the squared quadratic coefficient is such that when N is subtracted once (or twice, three times.. etc), we have a small number. This number will already be divisible by the primes they are assembled from ... and whatever remains will be so small, it almost garantuees it to be inside the factor base. That is  how you do it. That is how you make this work. How its really done. Good luck assholes.

Literally have more respect for the US, where I was threatened with a gun, then Europe. In Europe, I am literally wasting my life. Atleast in the US people showed the intent of making something happen, even if it didnt work out in the end. I fucking hate Europe. I will not die here wasting my life. I will go to Asia.
