!!!Work in progress!!!! 

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. Will build smooths on both sides of the congruences instead.

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Beginning to finalize the final version of the algorithm... should be done soon.
