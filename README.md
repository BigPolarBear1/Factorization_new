!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

One foot in the present, one foot in the future, we march on.

Cruel people think they answer to no-one, that the future is for them to take. But truth is, we all answer to what is to come, we are all judged. 
Dear, FBI, CIA, DoD, NSA ... please contemplate very deeply what this means as I burn your secrets. You cannot win this one. There is only going to be one outcome.

Good luck, you're all going to need it.
