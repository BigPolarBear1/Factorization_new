!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Fucking depressed. 1.5 years of unemployment and no income. Havnt seen my friends in a year. Just slowly becoming distant memories of better times. Applied to some companies in China and Singapore, but not expecting to hear back from them. 
I don't know if it even matter, because I am convinced my math will work.... I just need to finish it now.... just one final push. 
I'm just so mentally exhausted beyond belief. I wish my bank wasn't closing my account and hadn't blocked my savings... I could go for one last hike with the little I had left. Go to the Arctic.. live in a tent for a while.. 

Just sad. Every day I hear less and less from the handful of people who would still message me. I feel like a ghost, just waiting to die. I just got to find the energy tomorrow... and finish this... it's not that hard if I'm reducing everything to polynomials of the second degree.. I know everything about quadratics! Just exhausted after 1.5 years of nothing good happening, no income... stuck in a small room, far away from my friends... it's probably good they kicked me out of the US, bc if I was feeling there like I do here now.. I would be hunting for that fucker who threatened me with a gun and ruined my life every single day. 
I hope nobody gets in my face like that again, because right now, I could kill a person for real if they did that again. 

It's hard living like this. 
Right now, I would take any job in the world, relocate to anymore.... just to have some dignity again, my own place, my own freedom. *sigh* I don't know what to do anywhere. 
Fuck man, I would even go work for a crime organization right now if it got me out of living like this.... I rather have a few more years of dignity, then the slow death life has currently become.

I guess today was a sunday, maybe its not the end of the world to not get work do ne on a sunday and be depressed. Maybe tomorrow I should put my alarm early, get up, get my run in, and just destroy factorization like a savage bear, haha..

I notice a lot of suspicious signals ever since August 23rd when I first published my work.. and it hasn't decreased since then.. I'm definitely on someone's radar. But then again, its likely just a mix of threat intel folks and my Canadian stalker. If people were legit concerned about my work, they could just pay me and have it all for themselves, right? RIGHT????????????????????????? Maybe its wishful thinking due to depression and isolation.. wishing anything I did still mattered. Odds are people just think I've lost my mind, and they just google me like they go see animals in the zoo lol. 

Either one of two things are going to happen next week. I realize that all my findings up until now have just been a much weaker version of number field sieve due to my limited understanding, and I just limited myself to polynomials of the second degree for no good reason. Oooor... finding smooths with coefficients in mod p, will work, because of my very specific way of representing factorization as a system of quadratics.. the math I ran yesterday seems to indicate that it should.. yet with abstract algebra there is always the danger of overlooking hidden complexity somewhere.. I think I will legit quit life if this results in nothing but a waste of 2 years. Just nothing left but pain and sadness.. I just couldn't accept that reality.. hence this has to work now.

Its funny how people's identity is defined by politics. I hate the right, because I'm trans, and I had people insult me with words like tr*nny and p*do in the US.. but I also hate the left, because fuck drug dealers.. you need to bash their fucking heads in. I lost a friend to an overdose. The people who stole his life, they deserve to die. Or violent criminals harming innocents for greed. Like that one time, some Bulgarians broke into my grandfather's home and hit him over the head with a glas bottle, shortly after he had already suffered a stroke. That still makes me angry. I remember at the time, asking a friend to go drive around and see if we could find those fuckers. I believe there is nothing more sacred then innocent people and having fucking respect for people. Without that, there will never be peace on earth. Anyway............... numbers are more easy to understand then people. Thats why I completely isolate myself. I liked my manager.. but you fired him too and kicked me out of the country. And I also liked my teamlead, hanging out with him in Vancouver during covid was the best time of my life.... I doubt I will ever again in my life be surrounded by friends like that, its all over now.
