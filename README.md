!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Im so fucking depressed i cant sleep. How the fuck do i finish this math if i camt sleep.
Maybe I should just skip sleep. I can sleep when im dead, haha.

Life really has become a true nightmare.

Literally cannot sleep. Im so stressed and depressed. And its funny, bc Im so close with my work too now... I think people also know what is about to happen... and if they dont and still dismiss me.. yea well.. i am literally almost over the finish line.. just need some sleep and a good mood. I do completely understand it all now... my detour into QS was good to learn how these squares and quadratic coeffients relate... now the last step, to complete my work.. I am so at the end of my rope.. the math itself is not the hard part.. its being broke and hopeless and finding the energy to keep going day after day. The insane mental marathon. I really need a break, but im broke and I have nothing.
