# Factorization_new

Publishing my work-in-progress.

This demonstrates using quadratic coefficients to generate smooth numbers.
Current version run with: python3 QS.py -keysize 30 

Will only factor small semi-primes for now, this is a work in progress.
TO DO: When we generate smooth candidates, if the remainder is not 1 or -1, we can continue sieving this easily and find smooths a lot faster. I will try to finish this before the end of next weekend. Aside from that, everything else works as expected. Just the smooth generation is a bit sloppy.

It is supposed to still be slow. Because the smooth generation logic isn't implemented yet. It just generates numbers divisible by the factor base right now, that is all, there's no sieving or anything taking place. But the number theory works, and this already demonstrates that. Next is to implement this part... one step at a time. Making it public already, because I juts don't care anymore, like none of it matters anyway. Can't get a job. Been unemployed for over a year. No income. Nothing.

I only realized I could use my work to plug into QS a few days ago, so this is just all quickly put together in just a couple of days. I was exploring a different route before, but I think this one has more potential once I finish the smooth finding portion.. which should really just be a matter of solving linear congruences.

I'm fairly confident this is now the right direction to take my research. My previous mistake was not realizing that ANY valid coefficient combination has an infinite amount of matching squares mod n. Restricting myself to finding those two squares with 4N inbetween was my big mistakes. I hope to finish everything in the coming days. Tomorrow I'll take one day off to gather my thoughts, after that, I'll do one final push to finish this. I'm nearly there.. and you can see the code already, I'm not bluffing.

People are probably still laughing at everything I do. But I know I am nearly there now, this lets me hunt for smooths in ways that wasnt possible before. Its literally solving linear congruences now.. I just got to write the code. Just one day to take a break today, and then I continue full speed to the finish line.

Update 28/2: I think I have one way to do the sieving. Just a series of linear congruences. First generate a number divisible by the factor base. Secondly, see what remains. Then solve linear congruences to see the fewest amount of times N needs to be added/subtracted to get another factor within the factor base (or multiple factors in the factor base, I'll have to run some tests to see whats most efficient), then keep repeating that process until hopefully it turns into a smooth. Its not ideal, but should greatly improve the odds. And any factors that fall in our factor base we can ignore and only work with whats left, so if what remains is a very small number, then we can compute this process very quickly. Or some type of algorithm where we do congruences, and then only proceed if we can shrink the number outside the factor base. If I had more time, I could probably spent months on finding the best way to find smooths, Im certain a nice algorithm for this can be found. Also I think we should probably have very small factors like 2,3,5 also in our factor base (which are currently skipped in the PoC).. since these factors are the most commonly found, thus improving the odds of finding a smooth. I'll write the code tomorrow, for some reason I am feeling unfocused today.

Update: Bleh, cant sleep. Thinking about all the friends I left behind in the PNW region.. only to move back to Europe and be unemployed for over a year, all the good memories and times I had with my friends slowly fading to become distant memories.. going numb by the social isolation. Just torture every day.. Not that any of it will matter.. the entire world is unraveling before our eyes. People are blind and in denial. Weaponization of social media... many years ago someone realized how easily people can be brainwashed.. and somehow it led to today's insanity. Same with the entire anti-trans hystery, just easy prey for manipulators to spin false stories about and build fake narratives to get people riled up.. when I was young, nobody could understand how something like WWII could have happened.. but I can now. Except were we are headed now, it will be a horror show beyond comprehension. I hope when the end comes, it will be swift.

Update: Trouble focusing today. I'm basically there now, just feeling really depressed. With the changing political climate, there is no way I will ever be living near my former friends again. Honestly, in retrospect, its not suprising why msft went not just after me, but also went after my former manager, with blatant lies and portraying me as incompetent.. it's the same brainwashing that has poisoned a lot of america.. all trans people are incompetent and DEI, or whatever. Fuck MAGA. Don't come to Europe, fucking cowards. Pieces of shit. And fuck Hegseth and Tulsi, don't come to Europe.

Update: Implemented a first draft of the sieving logic. It works beautifully.. better then I expected. I should be good to release the updated PoC with sieving logic soon. Shouldn't have fired my manager simply bc he was one of the only people who actually stood up for me.. that was literally his only crime.. the reasons you invented to fire him were bullshit, everyone knows that.. textbook malicious compliance or whatever the hell its called, go to hell.... this is for my manager.. fucking assholes.

I like working on prime factorization, but as my current research is coming to an end, a much bigger challenge is revealing itself. The fundemental structure of composite numbers. This trick of finding squares, it only tells a small story.. its basically trying to find a quadratic with a 0 coefficient.. but why can't I find quadratics where the coefficient is not 0 and just work with those without reducing it to squares? I want to dig in to this problem and begin studying it a.s.a.p... I know this is what I really want to figure out.. everything else is a distraction. I'm just tired. I miss my friends. Hanging out with my teamlead in Vancouver during covid, it was the best time of my life, it all just seems like distant memories now. People and places I can't ever go back to. Besides my parents, there is nothing for me here in Belgium, I don't feel happy here. 

The saudis, israelis, russians and americans are all piece of shit cowards. I'll fight you all fuckers. You're all enemies of humanity and you're all on the wrong side of history. Seems like its only Europe and China left to be the voice of reason. Fucking cowards. Die in hellfire. Fucking idiots preparing to divide the world amongst themselves. If I was China, I would really begin to wake up to what America is doing. They are positioning themself so they can use the threat of force against China to get what they want, because nothing scares America more then the progress China is making. Fuck America. Go to hell.
