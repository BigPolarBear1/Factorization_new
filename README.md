!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (15 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.
Still trying to figure out how to fix the code in try_sm, right now it will ignore numbers that are too big. 
But I believe I have an idea how to resolve that. I'll upload a better version soon. #roadto200bit

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

Much better version will be published in the coming days.

TO DO: I will upload a newer version tomorrow. It will factor 200-bit on a laptop. I just really quickly skimmed through a paper on GNFS, it has a much better smooth finding method.. so if this beats standard QS... and I implement GNFS's way of smooth finding, will it beat standard GNFS too? Now THAT would be something... I'm so fucking broke, but my intuition is telling me there is something here.. hence I must push on. Always trust your intuition.. the universe works in mysterious ways.
