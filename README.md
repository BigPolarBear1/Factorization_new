!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: After reading about number field sieve, I realized I can use quadratic coefficients as algebraic factor base. This makes a lot more sense and would overcome many of the shortcomings of the uploaded PoC. I will upload a version using number field sieve's approach shortly.. my hope is that it not only improves this PoC but also improves existing number field sieve methods.

Note: I have been unemployed for over a year and am also still looking for work: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 

New york fbi and Belgian feds are too noisy. Good thing ill be in Asia soon, not going to wait for those fuckers to harass me.

They can close my bank account, freeze my money, but I'll simply make more money and get the hell out of this place. Can't stop me from going to Asia. There is nothing for me here in the west. Fuckers have literally put me on a sanctions list and are threatening folks who want to do business with me. There's no life nor future for me in the west. I'm getting the hell out of here asap.
