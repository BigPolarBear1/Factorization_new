hi!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me
