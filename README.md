!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (15 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.
Still trying to figure out how to fix the code in try_sm, right now it will ignore numbers that are too big. 
But I believe I have an idea how to resolve that. I'll upload a better version soon. #roadto200bit

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

Much better version will be published in the coming days.
