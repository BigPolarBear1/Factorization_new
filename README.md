!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!

Useage: python3 QS.py -keysize 60

Notes: Just uploaded my latest iterations (5 march 2025). It now uses linear congruences to generate numbers less then N which are then tested for smoothness.

Better version will be released soon...


Update: Absolute shit day. My Belgian bank is closing my account without stating a reason. Some days, it feels like people are making my life as miserable as possible. Just adding extra stress to everything to push my over the edge. 
I got to get out of this country soon, no matter what. I refuse to die here like this. Very late start... but lets finish the algorithm now... time to get to work. One final effort. LETS GO.

Update: hehe, this works. Let me finish a first rough outline in code tonight, then finetune it tomorrow and release.
