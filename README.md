!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!

Useage: python3 QS.py -keysize 60

Notes: Just uploaded my latest iterations (5 march 2025). It now uses linear congruences to generate numbers less then N which are then tested for smoothness.

Better version will be released soon...

Update:

To do:

Step 1. For each squared quadratic coefficient in mod p calculate how much N needs to be subtracted to reach 0.
Step 2. Multiply coefficients in different prime moduli together... such that the total amount of N being subtracted results in a small number. Hence, it being garantueed to be divisble by the primes that are multiplied, whatever factors remain will be small. 

I think this is the only way to do it quickly. 

Omg, my head is all over the place these last 2 weeks. Getting ideas, finding out they dont really work, getting wrong ideas. Seeing patterns where there are none. Just the depression. I feel so fucking depressed. Its impossible to focus. Just pain, pain for having had to leave behind my friends. Its all so long ago now. Just bashing my head against this stupid math, being isolated. I'm going to kill myself if I cant solve it soon.
