!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!

Useage: python3 QS.py -keysize 60

Notes: Just uploaded my latest iterations (5 march 2025). It now uses linear congruences to generate numbers less then N which are then tested for smoothness.

Better version will be released soon...

When summing quadratic coefficients, we just need to find sums, which are atleast bigger then N, but as small as possible mod N. That is definitely something I can do by means of heuristic or "weights". Then test if its in the factor base.. and move on. Then we dont need to worry about division mod N. My PoC already works, it generates numbers less then N... and we can keep generating them basically for eternity.. its just zero-ing in on small numbers mod N now.. because there is no point in testing large numbers for smoothness. Depressed. Nothing good is happenning in life. Lost my savings now. People in the west being told not to do business with me. I've been unemployed for over a year, without income.  All because some fuckers pointed a gun at me and shouted insults at me in Redmond. Anyone would become extremely agitated. I had told my manager about the harassment, and when he tried to protest them firing me, they also fired my manager. Just 0 respect for people at Microsoft. Doesn't matter how hard you work. Guess I'm turning 35 this week. Unemployed living with my parents. I'm either going to kill myself, move to China or turn to cyber crime. There isn't any other alternatives. Mostly sad, that the memories of all the friends I had are fading from memory..  I didn't think life would ever become like this again. Rollerblading around the seawall with my teamlead, that was some cool shit.. places and people I'll never see again thanks to microsoft. I dont know what im supposed to do.

Where previously smooth finding was a quadratic problem, it is now a linear one.. I just need to figure out now, how to isolate small values mod N. I don't see this approach anywhere in the public domain. I don't understand what's going on. All I understand is that western law enforcement is telling folks not to do business with me and that I see fucking IPs from the area of the US pentagon (DoD?) stalking me. Although I guess it wouldn't be completely impossible for some hater who stalks me to work in the pentagon. Also traffic searches for "sandboxescaper" have spiked ever since august of 23 when I released my first version of my math... yet I have never been more isolated, without social media accounts. Even a year ago, when my job search was getting a lot of attention, I only had a fraction of searches for "sandboxescaper" then I have now. Ofcourse it wouldn't be impossible I'm being stalked by some hate forum or something, hence all the traffic. Either that.. or people know my math is right and that its only a matter of time until I completely figure it out. Yea.. I can use signal intelligence too.. don't need to be a nation state. All very easy deductions to make.
