!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!

Notes: Just uploaded my latest iterations (5 march 2025). It now uses linear congruences to generate numbers less then N which are then tested for smoothness.

Better version will be released soon...

Damnit, I got basically everything figured out. We start with a squared quadratic coefficient, and we start dividing it mod N until we get something in the factor base (but it has to loop around N atleast once). 
Which can be reformulated as a weaker version of the discrete log problem.. since we don't need an exact residue, just a small one mod N, as that almost garantuees it to be in the factor base.
I know the math of it, and having a bunch of inverses to choose from, it should allow me to figure out how to choose a combination of inverses to get a small residue mod N. I know the exact math, how multiplying by inverses changes the residue .. I should be able to construct some kind of heuristic from that. Just hard to focus. I feel really depressed and I miss my friends. It's been a year now. And two years since I lived in Vancouver. Slowly the faces of the friends I had known fading out of memory, and time just relentlessly progressing. Stuck here, with months flying by and nothing good happening. Just the hate because of what Microsoft did to my Manager, portraying me as incompetent and fabricating lies so they could fire my manager without a severance. It makes me feel violent and angry. I hate these people. They will pay the price for what they have done.

In an ideal world, I would probably want to contemplate these finding for a while. Maybe go backpacking for a few weeks. With what I know now, I can already do a lot.. but I have this nagging feeling that there is an important insight that I'm missing still. I.e what if my quadratic coefficient itself is already within the factor base, why must there be atleast one N or more inbetween. I know why for my PoC to work, but I mean in mathematical terms. And I can see how finding smooths is in fact a discrete log problem..  dividing a number over mod N using divisors from the factor base until we get 1 as residue. But all of this, it's not just a gimmick of finding squares, there's something really deep here about divisibility.. and understanding this, would also result in me understanding DLP. I just wish I had more time.. I have a lot of dark thoughts. It is difficult to keep living like this. 

Hmm, if we have a number, and it cannot be divided by anything in the factor base, we can find a way to divide it mod N and generate a as small as possible number without bruteforce dividing by every possible combination in the factor base. I.e if that number mod 15 is 1, then we know its just doing that number -1, divided by 15 and adding that to the inverse.. meaning if the remainder is only 1, a bigger inverse has a bigger chance of wrapping around and generating a small number. But I need to generalize this into some type of heuristic that works for anything (not just remainder 1). I am 100% sure it can be done, it's not *that* complicated, I just need to think about how to do it in an elegant non-hacky way.

Ooooh. Eureka. I.e if we divide the quadratic coefficient and we get stuck on lets say 413, but we want to get an even smaller value.. we can do 413*x = 1 mod N. Then we test combinations of prime moduli against 413 and look for a residue that is the same as that x...  that nearly garantuees a value that's not going to be 1, but it will be close to it. Something like that... haha, I'm on fire today. And soon the world will be too. Everything I do is bc they fired my manager. Shouldn't have fired my manager.

I need some quiet place where I can think without dogs barking and other loud noises. I just cant think like this. All of this is sub-optimal. And I'm on my last couple thousand euros of savings. I don't know how im going to buy things I need after that. The situation is beginning to look quite bleak, hence my only way out is succeeding.

So just figure out, i.e if 413 is left ... 413*x = a mod N, figure out when that a is a small value. Which isn't hard to calculate. Then knowing that.. we need to find something 413 mod p1*p2*..  with the same residue as that a, because when we multiply but its inverses.. its going to multiply 413 by that amount and then add 413 divided by p1*p2*.. so now I am 100% certain it can be done. I understand how to do it. I can finish my work now. I just feel so god damn depressed today. Somehow the sudden spring weather brings back a lot of memories of places nad people I cant go back to anymore. I don't know how to cope with pain like that.
