!!!Work in progress!!!! 

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. Will build smooths on both sides of the congruences instead.

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Beginning to finalize the final version of the algorithm... should be done soon. 

Ok, who wants to buy my work in return for delayed publication of one year? Please email. Thanks.

The final version will find smooths without bruteforcing coefficient permutations... it's actually quite easy and a lot more straight forward then number field sieve, mainly due to our reduction to coefficients.
This next version will be a magnititude better then what is uploaded... this is my very final warning. I don't think anybody believes in my work... but if someone does, and wants to prevent what is going to happen... now is the time. 
Else whatever... this last year has been nothing but pain, and I don't really care anymore.
And all politicians rave about is anti-trans bullshit, fucking clown world. 
Maybe this had to happen.

Oh well... what does it even matter. I think if msft hadn't fired my manager, then maybe, there was a chance, this would have had another outcome.. but they fired the best manager in the world, so now I'm firing the world, haha. 

Great, someone reported this repo to github.
Fucking stalkers mad. For years these stalkers been reporting me everywhere to get me banned.
Fucking clowns. Cry more fucking stalkers. 
Anyway, took a day off yesterday.. time to get things ready for release now.

People are such bloody idiots. They do not know what I've worked out since my last release... this is going to straight up break factorization. It is so easy, using coefficients for every prime, to build smooths. Don't even need to go as complicated as NFS... just using those coefficients and some math is enough to figure it out without having to bruteforce or go into permutations. I never wanted it to go down like it is about to go down. But you treated me like a hostile entity... and now I will behave as one. Somewhere next week this "final" version will go online. At this point it is too late already anyway, as it wouldn't be far fetched for other math folks to already have figured it out also... 
I feel deep sadness, about the devastation in my life, and that of my friends. My manager didn't deserve the way he was treated. Back in 2019, he flew all the way to Belgium, to come meet me, when I was struggling and nobody in this industry wanted to hire me. One of the only people who believed in me. I just feel endless rage now. I will never let this injustice go. I will drag you all to hell with me.
