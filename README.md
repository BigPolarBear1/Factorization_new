!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (15 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.
Still trying to figure out how to fix the code in try_sm, right now it will ignore numbers that are too big. 
But I believe I have an idea how to resolve that. I'll upload a better version soon. #roadto200bit

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

Much better version will be published in the coming days.

Little bit depressed that I will have to delegate my math to my spare time again, as I've ran out of savings and need to find a way to leave Europe now.
I definitely still see a way forward with my research. I know where the bottlenecks are, and I have plenty of ideas now to explore.
One important thing I will definitely do next is deeply study the GNFS algo, because QS is now easy to understand for me... but now I want to learn number field sieve, and see if there is any inspiration there.
It's only a matter of time until I truely start breaking barriers with my research.. I started at the most granular/basic level and worked my way up, all of this has given me a very intuitive feel for the problem, even if it took me 2 years (I started with pre-highschool math knowledge), I know I can succeed eventually. I already know that for the remainder of my life, I am going to keep grinding this problem, I am not ever quitting this.. this is something I need to solve, no matter the personal cost.

Anyway, will upload a version that can get above 200 bit on a laptop later this week.
