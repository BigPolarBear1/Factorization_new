!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Fucking depressed. 1.5 years of unemployment and no income. Havnt seen my friends in a year. Just slowly becoming distant memories of better times. Applied to some companies in China and Singapore, but not expecting to hear back from them. 
I don't know if it even matter, because I am convinced my math will work.... I just need to finish it now.... just one final push. 
I'm just so mentally exhausted beyond belief. I wish my bank wasn't closing my account and hadn't blocked my savings... I could go for one last hike with the little I had left. Go to the Arctic.. live in a tent for a while.. 

Just sad. Every day I hear less and less from the handful of people who would still message me. I feel like a ghost, just waiting to die. I just got to find the energy tomorrow... and finish this... it's not that hard if I'm reducing everything to polynomials of the second degree.. I know everything about quadratics! Just exhausted after 1.5 years of nothing good happening, no income... stuck in a small room, far away from my friends... it's probably good they kicked me out of the US, bc if I was feeling there like I do here now.. I would be hunting for that fucker who threatened me with a gun and ruined my life every single day. 
I hope nobody gets in my face like that again, because right now, I could kill a person for real if they did that again. 

It's hard living like this. 
Right now, I would take any job in the world, relocate to anymore.... just to have some dignity again, my own place, my own freedom. *sigh* I don't know what to do anywhere. 
Fuck man, I would even go work for a crime organization right now if it got me out of living like this.... I rather have a few more years of dignity, then the slow death life has currently become.

I guess today was a sunday, maybe its not the end of the world to not get work do ne on a sunday and be depressed. Maybe tomorrow I should put my alarm early, get up, get my run in, and just destroy factorization like a savage bear, haha..
