!!!Work in progress!!!! 

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. Will build smooths on both sides of the congruences instead.

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Update: Internet went down for an entire day. Fucking twilight zone.
It doesnt matter. I know people will downplay me, untill my final version comes online, which will be soon.
Guess there is safety in not getting taken seriously.
Ive worked out one way to build smooths on both sides of a congruences already. Going to do math for a few more days to make sure there isnt an even easier way.. and after that the math should be done.
All this shit, people trying to ruin my life.. its not going to matter soon...

I try not to think about the absurdity of it all. 
I just wanted to be with my friends.

A few more days now... then all of this is finally over.

Alright... I think I have the most optimal solution for finding smooths mod P.

If we have p * q = 41 * 107 = 4387   .. we can write this as 41^2 -148 * 41 + 4387 = 107^2 - 66 * 107 - 4387 ... which we can turn into an equation with variables.. and reduce to prime fields ... find smooths on both sides.. etc
