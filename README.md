hi!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Bleh... cant sleep. I know I can build smooths like number field sieve does. I know I have all the pieces. I don't need to combine coefficients first like I'm doing in my quadratic sieve PoC... *sigh*
So depressed. I cant believe my fucking life anymore. Im so angry at everything that has happened. Just treated like complete trash, after so many years of hard work.

Fuck it. a^2 = b^2 mod N, both side can be represented seperately in an exponent matrix... number field sieve shows how. I know one side can be constructed by combining quadratic coefficients and squaring them...  that is EASY. However, I don't want to combine them above a certain threshold, I want to find smooths with coefficients mod p ideally and plug that into my square finding matrix...... so let me figure out the number theory for that first ... and I know how the other side is derived from that, so once I figure this out, then figuring that out should be straight forward. One step at a time... 

I swear, someone knows. Someone knows I am right about my approach. And damn you all to hell for treating me like the enemy. If I act the way I do, its exactly for these reasons. You all deserve to burn in hell. After all I have done in my career, bugs in OpenSsl, Secure Channel, IKE, kerberos ... etc etc... this is how I get treated lol. You're all going to burn for this.
