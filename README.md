!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: After reading about number field sieve, I realized I can use quadratic coefficients as algebraic factor base. This makes a lot more sense and would overcome many of the shortcomings of the uploaded PoC. I will upload a version using number field sieve's approach shortly.. my hope is that it not only improves this PoC but also improves existing number field sieve methods.

Note: I have been unemployed for over a year and am also still looking for work: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 

Fuck america. fucking nazi pieces of shit. Were it not for their fucking spreading of misinformation about trans people, I wouldnt have been harassed and threatened with a gun. I would still be with my friends. Go to hell. No foreigner in their right mind will seek employment in the US. America is dead already.
