!!!Work in progress!!!!

Uploaded a new version (18 march):

Will factor 150 bit in a couple of minutes on a laptop.

Use: python3 QS.py -keysize 150

To do: Final version will be released soon. It borrows number field's smooth finding strategy together with everything I have learned using quadratic coefficients. It will allow you to find smooths using small polynomials of the second degree... 

Still looking for work, will relocate: big_polar_bear1@proton.me

Seriously fuck Europe, fuck Belgium. I'll fight the Belgian government, fucking cunts all of them. I despise this country. Getting out of here no matter the cost. Even if I need to turn to crime. Come get me. I'm ready to die. I'll go out fighting you all fuckers.

Fuck Europe too. Literally, European infosec are fucking cunts. All they know is android,  ios and chrome. If I ever meet one of these cunts, I'll bash their fuckings heads in. Fucking politics. Telling their federal friends to not do business with me, bc they know I would outcompete them. Fucking no talent shithead losers. Cunts who havnt worked hard once in their lives. I'm ready to die. I'll fight all these fuckers.

Belgian feds better watch their backs. Fucking cunts.

You know what the irony is? Its that none of that fucking android/ios/chrome attack surface shit is hard. They all pretend like they are the best or some shit. You just read code you fucking nerds. You do client side execution, wow, so hard. Fucking morrons. No skill losers.

Fuck man. Going to go find some more Chinese companies to apply to today. I'm getting out of this death trap no matter what. Fuck belgium and fuck europe. Not going to die here like this you stupid fuckers.
