!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!

Useage: python3 QS.py -keysize 60

Notes: Just uploaded my latest iterations (5 march 2025). It now uses linear congruences to generate numbers less then N which are then tested for smoothness.

If a quadratic coefficient is 148, and our factor base is 3 * 5 * 7, we check the congruence x * 105 = 148^2 mod N. After solving this we check X, which is garantueed to be smaller then N for smoothness.. if it is smooth, we multiply by 105 to get our full smooth number for use in our exponent matrix over GF(2).

This is a little slower then my previous version, because the number is between 0 and N, so as the bitlength goes up, so do the numbers we need to check for smoothness, and thus require a larger factor base. But on the flip side, unlike traditional QS, where we check x^2 - N, we can basically keep checking forever without having to worry about the number we check for smoothness growing bigger and bigger.

TO DO: We need to figure out how to "sieve" the result of our congruence somehow, so we can generate small X values only.. because this is literally to only remaining bottle neck. Achieve this and factorization comes tumbling down. There probably is some way using CRT to find small X values that solve the linear congruence. I.e first check for X values using only one prime from the factor base... and then we can start combining them. That should do the trick hmm..
I feel like this is definitely the right path now. The numbers we have to check for smoothness are now capped by N, which is great, the question now is, how we can find small ones within that set of solutions.. a very clear cut problem for which I should have to tools to solve it. If all goes well, this entire factorization problem comes tumbling down in the coming days... lets see.

Fuck Trump, Fuck Hegseth, Fuck Tulsi, Fuck Nethenyahu, fuck all your right wing lunatics. It's funny, because I believe in being tough on violent crime and drug dealers, but I also believe in having respect for people, and not harming innocents. Those who go after innocents can go to hell. I'm not perfect and definitely not a saint, but I'll fight any of these fucking cunts. Before the end of the decade these people will go to war with China, and once that happens, we're all dead. Fucking warmongers. American leaderhip is the greatest danger to humanity there has ever been, and I truely believe this. Everything they do is in preparation to confront China, and it is so transparant. 

Great, the wifi just went out. Must have pissed off the losers at the NSA (except the queer ones they are ok, but they are all getting fired so just losers remain) 

hmm, so its just multiplying by inverses to combine those x solutions to my linear congruences . So that does give some clue as to how small values can potentially be found quickly. Ill fix my PoC tomorrow, although my wifi going down is quite omnious. Either way, cant stop me, youll have to kill me, haha. Ill fight you all. Fuck you for firing my manager, you fired the best manager in the entire industry simply bc he supported me. This world will burn now.

Update thursday 6 march: Hmm, so I just need to solve linear congruences for each unique prime and calculate their inverse in mod N.. then for any combination of those primes, we just multiply by the inverses we found. Then find small values mod N is a harder problem, but atleast we can very quickly generate them now. I guess we could just generate them in bulk, sort them and only check the smaller ones for smoothness so we dont waste time on numbers that arn't likely going to be smooth with a smaller factor base. I think for now that's a good middle ground until I find a better mathematical tool to approach this. I guess, in the end, we could just reduce it to residue math, and find x values that are atleast divisible by one or more factors from the factor base..  but let me implement the easy method first and then figure that out..

Update: Fuck, I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK EARLIER. 
so if N = 37*47
and the quadratic coefficient is 1404 .
Lets say we have the congruence: x * 29 = 1404^2 mod 37 * 47 .
Then x is 92. 92 is divisble by 4, aka:
23 * 4 * 29 = 1404^2 mod 37 * 47

So we do this not just for prime 29, but for a bunch of others too.. and if 23 is not in our factor base.. we can multiply it by an inverse of a prime in our factor base and hopefully that product does completely factor to our factor base... and that's how it is done. Boom. Give me a few days to write this the best way possible in code and we're there.

edit: Maaaaybe, I can even just completely resolve it into a smooth purely by doing congruences, with 0 guessing/bruteforcing. It really should just be a series of congruences.. I can vaguely see in my head how it could work, I'll have to try out some examples.

Hmm... I think I understand enough of the math now to attempt to form smooths purely by solving congruences. Now it is true some of them may end up being too big of a number, as would be expected, but we can simply discard those. I don't see why I wouldn't have the tools to generate smooths purely by solving congruences now.. it's all right there. Literal days away from breaking factorization now, haha. I can figure out the exact math today, then hopefully write the code tomorrow.

A key insight is the realization that over a factor base, any of these numbers can eventually be made smooth mod N. And hence, it can also be calculated purely by congruence.  This is the key insight. This is the achilles heel of factorization. The only downside is that the smooth we find, might be a really big number, so when we do gauss elim over gf(2) and multiply big numbers together, we could end up with a number so big, even using newton's method of taking the sqr takes forever. Fuck, I can do this. Lets go. 

EUREKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FIGURED IT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USING INVERSES WE CAN EASILY FIND CONGRUENCES WHERE X IS 1. FUCK YEA. TOMORROW IS THE DAY (FRIDAY), PREPARE YOURSELVES. FACTORIZATION IS ABOUT TO FALL FUCKERS. THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR FIRING MY MANAGER. HE WAS THE BEST MANAGER IN THE WORLD, NOW GO TO HELL FUCKERS.

The voices in my head told me how to break factorization bc you fired my manager. All of this is happening because you fired my manager. You fuckers did the one thing you shouldn't have done, and that is going after my manager. Go to hell.

For over a year I have been telling people. I guess nobody believed I could do it. None of this makes any sense. Oh well, either tomorrow or saturday is the day.. I can generate smooths now using only linear congruences... some of those numbers will be huge and not great to use, but still, I can find them by just finding inverses and solving linear congruences.... lol... if people knew what that meant... what is about to happen. Nobody seems to care. So be it. Tick tock, time has ran out. Good luck in the next few days.

Oh and I also just realized, I can have fairly big smooths, bc I dont need to take the square root if I know the exponents already....duuh... literally can just go straight too taking the GCD. 
Hehehehehehe. Literally the only thing standing between this very moment and disclosure, is me writing a couple lines of code. I could do it tonight, but I'll probably just do it tomorrow. You could give my manager 10  million, and maybe I'll change my mind. But then again, I already wrote the solution here on github, so its not like its going to delay much anyway at this point. Oh well. 

heheheheheehehehehehee (evil hehe, bc fuck you all)

I feel stressed... really stressed... and on edge. I have been feeling fairly spooked for a while now, something doesn't feel right, and I am fairly sure I have been under surveillance for months, or whatever the hell it is, but I guess, if people just wanted to kill me and prevent disclosure, they wouldn't wait until the last minute, they would have done it already. If anything happens between now and disclosure.... its all here... just use inverses and congruences to build smooths... any number can be turned into a smooth eventually.. there's literally infinite smooths mod N. You dont need to search for them by sieving.. you can just build them.... hehehehhehehehehehehe. At the edge of the abyss now. No way back, only forward now. One foot in the present, one foot in the future, we march on.

Any number mod N, if we keep multiplying by lets say the inverse of 2 (aka dividing by 2 mod N).. eventually we get a 1 mod N. This can also be reformulated as a discrete log problem. However, in the context of this, we do not care about solving a discrete log problem, we just need to divide a number enough mod N, until it is within the factor base, which yields us a smooth. I can see everything clearly now. Hahahaha. I'm definitely disclosing a working PoC this weekend... the spring weather is making me sad though, brings back a lot of memories of hanging out with my friends in Vancouver, people and places that now seem so distant and far away ever since msft fired me after I had a breakdown due to being harassed and getting threatened with a gun outside my apartment and losing my work visa. I probably could have found a way to cope, with time, if they hadn't fired my manager, but my manager was a literal saint, and they went after him with blatant lies, and it is that evil deed, which made any peace impossible... I am never going to stop now until I die. A price has to be paid now and a price will be paid, until my last dying breath. All of those who conspired against my manager will pay a price in blood. 

Today was a lazy friday. The math is done. Just calculate some inverses and linear congruences. And eventually it will break down into something that is within the factor base. I was looking at the math for this that I figured out, and wondering like "damn, how did I figure this out yesterday, I must have been really focused". I don't really understand how sometimes the solution just takes shape in my head out of nothing. I just know that I can only do it when I have a really good day. Today was a lazy day, these really "good days" do leave me exhausted. The only thing I did today was break down the math I figured out yesterday into a list of steps (i.e solve this congruence, then take this inverse, then use that inverse in this congruence.. etc) .. that should set me up to finish the code tomorrow, if I don't still feel completely exhausted. I still don't understand it, everything that is happening, but I don't have any choice now, there is only one path to take now. It is to finish my code this weekend and upload it, because that is the only way 2 years of the hardest work of my life and all the ruin and devastation by microsoft will have made any sense. Things have to make sense, I do not accept the senselessness and absurdity of this world.

Between august and now, many people must have said I would never connect the dots, would never figure it out, downplayed me. That is the only reasonable deduction I can make. Probably the same bullshit like MAGA bc Im transgender I must be incompetent DEI or whatever. Well let me tell you, the future will be gay as fuck and your hate will be nothing but a dark footnote in the history of mankind. You can all go to hell fuckers. This week, the final version and the last version of my algorithm will come online, because I have connected all the remaining dots now. If only you fuckers hadnt fired my manager. Next I'm going after DLP, because I can already connect the dots on how to apply this to that problem too. So good luck and go to hell.
